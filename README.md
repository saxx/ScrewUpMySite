ScrewUpMySite
=============
This is just a stupid little demo project of mine to play around with SignalR. All it does is to distribute certain HTML style changes (like background-color, font-family, ...) to all clients.

See http://screwupmysite.azurewebsites.net/ for a live example.

Don't hesitate to use the code anywhere you like; send me a pull request if you make useful changes.
